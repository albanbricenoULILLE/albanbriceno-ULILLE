2. CNC laser cutting and engraving preprocessing

The operating procedure for laser cutting and engraving can differ depending on the machine used.
In this file, lines are 0.1 mm thick and use two colors: red (RGB 255, 0, 0) for cutting and blue (RGB 0, 0, 255) for engraving.
The engraving process should be set to the laser’s Vector mode, which reduces power compared to cutting.
Please avoid using Raster mode, as it is not ideal in this scenario.
Keep in mind that settings may vary depending on the CNC laser machine, and adjustments might be needed in the control software. Be sure to update the .svg file accordingly using design software like Inkscape or CorelDRAW.

3. Device control / ReaSurroundPan REAPER Preset 

The preset file must be imported from REAPER into the ReaSurroundPan plugin. 
To configure your REAPER session and control the device:
  a. set your multichannel audio interface device in your computer's audio output configuration AND in REAPER's Settings window (you may need to install drivers supplied by the manufacturer).
  b. set the Outputs in the MASTER track ("ROUTE" button); Track channels = 8; Audio Hardware Output "multichannel-source" = "1-8".
  c. load "ReaSurroundPan" from the MASTER FX window ("FX" button).
  d. import the preset file from the "+" button, then "Import VST patch/bank file".
  e. insert a new track, then any virtual instrument or audio input.
  f. ROUTE the track signal to the MASTER "ALL" -> "1-8"; Track channels = 8.

For optimal performance, we recommend applying a low-pass filter after the instrument to reduce frequencies above 250 Hz.
You can control the source with a pointing device (mouse, touchpad, touchscreen, trackball), automation, or a MIDI hardware interface (such as a fader or pad).
Take care to avoid exceeding peak levels or overloading the speaker with too much power.
